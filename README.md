# Pyth3rEx

Builder focused on **Cybersecurity**, **AI/ML**, and **Game Modding**.  
I design, analyze, and test systems with an adversarial mindset to build software that is secure, intelligent, and robust.

## 🔍 Core Focus
- **Cybersecurity** — defensive and offensive security concepts, tooling, and analysis
- **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning** — applied models and data-driven systems
- **Game Modding** — extending and reshaping complex game systems

## 📂 What I Build
- **Security tooling & research** — analysis, automation, and experimentation  
  *(public repositories and private research environments)*
- **AI/ML projects** — prototypes, models, and applied learning
- **Game mods** — gameplay and system extensions

Security work is conducted in **controlled, ethical environments** and often maintained privately.
